# TIMELINE
#### A game by April Castenda, Victoria Fisher and Katie Stutts

Which came first -- the public release of the internet or the first video game? With Timeline, learn the answer to this question and hundreds of others by comparing your knowledge or hunches to historic reality. At the beginning of the game, you will get a specified number of cards representing inventions, pop culture, historical events, etc. On the back of each card is a year. 

To begin, one card is randomly drawn from the deck and is placed in the middle of the table, and is the starting point of a chronological line which will slowly be built by the player. The player then chooses one of their cards. If the player thinks that the event/invention on their card came before that of the initial card, the player places their card to the "left" of the initial card. If they feel that the event/invention on their card was created after, it is placed to the "right" of the initial card. If the player was right, it remains on the table. Otherwise, the card is discarded and a new one must be drawn to replace it. 

All the while, you are racing against the clock! You have only a certain number of turns to guess correctly before the game ends!

The more cards which are correctly played, the harder it is to correctly place new ones. The player wins when they correctly place all of the cards in their hand.
